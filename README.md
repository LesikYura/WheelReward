## "Daily Bonus Roulette"

The primary goal was to demonstrate a strong understanding of clean architecture principles within Unity, focusing on a robust and maintainable codebase.

### **Key Technical Highlights:**
1. **Unity** 2022
2. **MVVM Architecture**: Strict adherence to MVVM, with distinct Model, ViewModel, and View layers.
* **Model**: Pure C# data structures representing bonus items and roulette logic, independent of Unity.
* **ViewModel**: Transforms Model data for the View and handles user interactions, exposing observable properties and commands.
* **View**: Passive Unity UI elements responsible solely for rendering data provided by the ViewModel and initiating animations.
3. **DOTween Integration** 
4. **Testability**
